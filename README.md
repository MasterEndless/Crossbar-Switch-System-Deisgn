# Crossbar-Switch-System-Deisgn
Design of a data packet routing system to tackle communication  between different modules in a common bus
This project is aimed to design a crossbar switch sysytem, which could solve the problems that communication between different modules in a common bus.  
The code is implemented in VHDL, a common CAD tool(Vivado etc.) could run this code.
